    <h3>What is the Open Infra License (OIL)?</h3>
    <p>The Open Infra License (OIL) is a permissive open source license designed to promote collaboration and innovation for open source software/infra.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Features of OIL</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Permissive: Allows for both open source and partly proprietary use. (min. 35% of code of the software applied must be open source.)</li>
        <li>Simple: Easy to understand and apply.</li>
        <li>Flexible: Suitable for a wide range of projects and use cases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Use OIL?</h3>
    <p>Using OIL allows you to leverage the benefits of open source while maintaining a massive level of control over your code. It encourages contributions and collaboration from the community.</p>

Preamble

The Open Infra License (OIL) v1.1 is designed to protect and promote open-source software while preventing monopolization and closed-source exploitation...

1. Grant of License
    
1.1. Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or entity (the "Licensee") obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, subject to the conditions stated in this license.

1.2. Any derivative work, fork, modification, or redistribution of the Software must ensure that at least 35% of the project's total codebase remains open-source under the same terms as this license. This requirement applies to all subsequent versions and forks.

1.3. The Software may be used for commercial and non-commercial purposes without restriction, provided that compliance with this license is maintained.

2. Transparency and Source Code Availability

2.1. The Licensee must maintain public access to the source code of at least 35% of the Software at all times. This portion must include core functional components, ensuring meaningful open-source contributions rather than insignificant fragments.

2.2. Any entity redistributing or modifying the Software must provide a link to the original repository and acknowledge the original authors.

2.3. If a project governed by this license ceases to be maintained, any forked version must retain an accessible open-source repository.

3. Restrictions on Monopolistic Use and Exploitation

3.1. No entity with a market dominance exceeding 70% in its sector may integrate or modify the Software without making a 100% open-source fork available under the same license.

3.2. The Software may not be integrated into proprietary systems where its open-source nature is obscured, restricted, or locked behind paywalls.

3.3. Redistribution in any manner that restricts end-users from accessing the required open-source portion is strictly prohibited.

3.4. Licensees may not relicense the Software under any terms that reduce its open-source nature.

4. Forking, Contributions, and Community Rights

4.1. Forking is encouraged but must comply with all transparency and openness requirements stated in this license.

4.2. Contributions to the Software are governed by the contributor's license agreement, ensuring that modifications remain open-source under the same terms.

4.3. No contributor or maintainer may introduce changes that result in reducing the open-source ratio below the 35% minimum threshold.

5. Commercial Use and SaaS Deployments

5.1. The Software may be used for commercial purposes, provided that any modifications or enhancements made to the open-source portion must be publicly shared.

5.2. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) implementations based on the Software must either contribute back modifications to the open-source community or provide an API allowing interoperability with other open-source projects under this license.

6. License Compliance and Enforcement

6.1. The Open Infra Foundation (OIF) reserves the right to conduct audits on projects claiming compliance with this license.

6.2. Non-compliance with this license may result in revocation of rights under the OIL v1.1 and may lead to legal action to protect the open-source nature of the Software.

6.3. Any legal disputes arising from this license shall be governed by the jurisdiction of the Open Infra Foundationâ€™s headquarters, unless otherwise agreed upon by all parties involved.

7. No Warranty and Limitation of Liability

7.1. The Software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

7.2. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Software or the use or other dealings in the Software.

8. Future Versions and Amendments

8.1. This license may be updated to ensure its continued effectiveness in protecting open-source principles.

8.2. Any future amendments will be published and maintained by the Open Infra Foundation. Projects licensed under this version may adopt newer versions but are not obligated to do so.
